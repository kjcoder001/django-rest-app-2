  THIS FILE CONTAINS ALL THE TEXT THAT WAS PRESENT BEFORE BUT DELETED LATER TO BE REPLACED BY BETTER VERSION OF
  THE SAME CODE.

  THIS WAS DELETED AFTER 2ND COMMIT TO GIT FORM  views.py in courses app.
  The APIView  has been replaced by generics in the next commit.

  class ListCourse(APIView):

      def get(self,request,format=None):
          courses=models.Course.objects.all()# lists all the objects from the database

          serializer=serializers.CourseSerializer(courses,many=True)
          # many lets the serializer know that multiple courses are being passed to serialize
          # Serialization process is taking place here where text-string(fields and their values from the databse) gets converted to json format
          return Response(serializer.data)
          # serializer.data is essentially a dictionary . Rsponse() method renders it to json format.

      def post(self,request,format=None):
          serializer=serializers.CourseSerializer(data=request.data)
          # entry is made in json format ; deserialization takes place here.json format gets coverted to
          #native datatypes

          serializer.is_valid(raise_exception=True)
          # .is_valid() method can be used only when it has a data keyword argument in it.It simply validates the
          # entries and continues if everything's alright else raises an exception

          serializer.save()
          #Saves the entry to our Database.
          # Updates the serializer in memory,i.e as soon as we hit save() ,the serializer class gets assigned
          # an id , created_at etc.So now serializer.data(a dictionary)has all the attributes to display them in a view.
          #Important:-serializer.save() method either calls the create() or update() of the serialzer class;
          # depending on whether an instance of the object was passed (update),.
          return Response(serializer.data,status=status.HTTP_201_CREATED)
